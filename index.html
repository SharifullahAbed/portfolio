        <h1>I am Sharifullah <span>Abed</span></h1>
        <p><strong>Born in 2000 </strong>in Nangarhar province during the Taliban regime. I found it difficult to receive a good quality education in my village as the school standards were very low in rural areas. My family moved to the city of Nangarhar
            province, so I could start my secondary education properly. It was during this time I found my passion and analytical skills with Computers by being able to understand and work with computers easily myself. <br><br> <strong>After living in the city for a year</strong>,
            I understood computers to an extent where I was able to train my siblings and neighborhood how to use the computer and learn its initials. <br> <br> <strong>However</strong>, after the Taliban takeover of Kabul, I was obliged to move to Sulaymaniyah,
            Iraqi Kurdistan, to continue my education online. Still, my academic career seems to be uncertain here as well as I am staying in a third country with an unknown future. <br> <br> <strong>I firmly believe</strong> that continuing my undergraduate
            in US-based IT universities will let me enhance my software knowledge, strengthen my academic career, be able to fill the gap of professionals in the field of software engineering and machine learning, and prove myself as an influential policymaker
            for my country by studying in one of the top IT schools.
